## Run the API

> [!WARNING]
> The API and the authentication system is nothing like how it is in the real world. It was not made by me and you should NOT use this as an example for a working authentication. You should always use something like sessions or jwt or something that's a lot more secure. This project doesn't reflect my knowledge on the matter.
